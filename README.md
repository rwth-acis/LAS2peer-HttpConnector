LAS2peer-HttpConnector
======================

A connector for LAS2peer that enables communication with 
a LAS2peer server via HTTP.  

Please mind, that you only need to checkout this project
if you want to work on the connector itself.  

This connector should be used if you want to port an existing LAS service to LAS2peer.
For all new services, please use the 
[LAS2Peer-Template-Project](https://github.com/rwth-acis/LAS2peer-Template-Project/),
which already contains the pre-build Web-Connector a newer version of the HTTP connector
that enables RESTful access to LAS2peer.
