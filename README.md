LAS2peer-HttpConnector
======================

A connector for LAS2peer that enables communication with 
a LAS2peer server via HTTP.  

Please mind, that you only need to checkout this project
if you want to work on the connector itself.  
Otherwise, please use the 
[LAS2Peer-Sample-Service-Project](https://github.com/rwth-acis/LAS2peer-Sample-Service/),
which already contains the pre-build HTTP-Connector.
